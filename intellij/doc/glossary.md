# Glossary

# Analytics:

General term for a page created by us to display and highlight different trends in data and other information we think might be useful to display. Examples include: overall Deece ratings over period of time (week, month), top dishes of the week, highlighting specific dishes (displaying dish profile). We envision this page to be very closely tied with the forum being the two aspects of socialization within this app being connected by the ability to easily swipe back and forth between the two.

# Deece:

Vassar College's dining hall that is being reviewed

# Forum:

Reddit-style forum created to display individual dish or overall Deece reviews. Users can interact by posting, commenting, and reacting to reviews.

# Menu:

Displaying the menu we envision a UI where you are able
to easily move from station to station (ie. Global, Home, Root, etc.)
that has an overlay for numerical ratings denoting 
dish ratings.

# Dish:

We count each dish as each individual listing under Cafe Bon Appetit
and use this to represent each unique item being offered at the Deece at a 
given time.

# Review: 

Referring to both written reviews and numerical reviews,
we allow for both. We allow reviews for dishes (numerical and written) 
and Deece (numerical only).
