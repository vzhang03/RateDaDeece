# Iteration Plan

High
* Check menu (Cafe BonAppetit data)
* Review Deece Overall
* Leave numerical review (dish profiles)

Medium
* See analytics
* Leave written review (anonymous user profiles)

Low
* See forum

# Iteration Plan Part Two

* Figure out how to use the users classes to: manage reviews,
control how often can review
* Finish up the javascript parsing 
* Figure out how to connect the parsing and the current interface 
-- keeping track of current menu while maintaining previous menu 
* Work on forum/analytics

# Iteration Plan Part 2
* Work on connecting users into logic -- preventing from leaving multiple reviews,
creating profiles to be able to view dishes and reviews a person has left
* Work on analytics, displaying when users open the app (ideally with a 
deece information)
* Create a userpage to figure out how to display a user's information
* Fix the formatting of the elements 
* Work on the two parts of persistence -- figure out how to incoporate the
logic to work with the rest of the project
  * local persistence for the user information
  * cloud persistence for the deece information
